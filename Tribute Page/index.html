                Here's a timeline of Stanilav Petrov how took a immediate desicion to save the world from disaster.
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Petrov was born on 7 September 1939 near Vladivostok. His father, Yevgraf, flew fighter aircraft
                    during World War II. His mother was a nurse.</li>
                <li>Petrov enrolled at the Kiev Higher Engineering Radio-Technical College of the Soviet Air Forces, and
                    after graduating in 1972 he joined the Soviet Air Defence Forces.</li>
                <li>In the early 1970s, he was assigned to the organization that oversaw the new early warning system
                    intended to detect ballistic missile attacks from NATO countries.</li>
                <li>Petrov was married to Raisa, and had a son, Dmitri, and a daughter, Yelena. His wife died of cancer
                    in 1997.</li>
                <li>Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defence Forces who played a
                    key role in the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident.</li>
                <li>Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the
                    system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five
                    more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm, and his decision to disobey orders, against
                    Soviet military protocol, is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack
                    on the United States and its NATO allies that could have resulted in a large-scale nuclear war which
                    could have wiped out half of the population of the countries involved.</li>
                <li>An investigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned.
                    Because of this incident, Petrov is often credited as having "saved the world".</li>
                <li>In 1984, Petrov left the military and got a job at the research institute that had developed the
                    Soviet Union's early warning system. He later retired so he could care for his wife after she was
                    diagnosed with cancer. A BBC report in 1998 stated Petrov had suffered a mental breakdown and quoted
                    Petrov as saying, "I was made a scapegoat."</li>
                <li>During a visit to the United States for the filming of the documentary The Man Who Saved the World,
                    Petrov toured in May 2007 the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site and, having retired from USSR
                    military, commented, â€œhe would never have imagined being able to visit one of the enemy's securest
                    sites</li>
                <li>Petrov died on 19 May 2017 from hypostatic pneumonia, though it was not widely reported until
                    September.</li>
